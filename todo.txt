Rethink how we are doing the rollouts
Have the classes update them is confusing 
Just have everything return a new message and append to chat
That's easier and more flexible in future if we do wnat to change how that works 
Asides form that rought structure seems good
Make more things stateless - stateless generally good
Have env return the new state and the message then we can just keep track of ourselves in trainer
